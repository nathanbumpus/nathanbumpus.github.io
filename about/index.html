  <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
  <p>I recently finished my Masters Degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Maine in May of 2019.  During my time in graduate school I aspired to gain the computer science skills that would make me 
an ideal candidate for the role of an entry level bioinformatics analyst or research assistant.  I have completed data analysis projects in Python using using scipy, matplotlib, pandas and numpy.  I have
used various R packages such as edgeR, DESeq2 and Pathview to explore and analyze large genomic datasets.  For my graduate research project I developed a pipeline facilitating the use of Trinity software 
in producing de novo transcriptome assemblies on the high performance computing clusters at the University of Maine.  Recently as my own side project I wrote a python program that allows me to store literary
works from open source sites like Project Gutenberg in large strands of DNA.  Not very useful but kind of fun.</p>

<p>Before I was a graduate student I worked as a Medical Laboratory Technologist for about seven years in various hospital settings.  The most notable was a level one trauma center in Portland, Maine.  There 
I worked on the evening shift in every department of a stat laboratory.  I was also responsible for any coagulation factor assays that might arise during that time.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate career at the University of Maine at Augusta I excelled as a Medical Laboratory Technology and Biology student and was awarded the Celeste Cote Memorial Scholarship for the top 
student in my curriculum.  I also took courses in Molecular Cell Biology, Genetics and Biochemistry.  I graduated suma cum laude with a GPA of around 3.9 with an Associates of Science in Medical Laboratory 
Technology and a Bachelor of Arts in Biology.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy backpacking, camping, volunteering at a local food bank, making paper airplanes and daisy chaining emulators through virtual machines to play old video games.</p>
